A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which are carried out from a single source, DDoS attacks involve multiple sources, often thousands or even millions of compromised devices (such as computers, IoT devices, or servers) distributed across the internet.

The primary goal of a DDoS attack is to exhaust the target's resources, such as bandwidth, processing power, or network connections, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Attackers achieve this by coordinating the simultaneous sending of a massive volume of requests or traffic to the target, overwhelming its capacity to handle incoming requests and causing it to become slow or completely unresponsive
